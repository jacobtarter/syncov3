  <div class="scitechcontainer">
  <div class="description">All planets have 4 things that describe them - they orbit the sun, they donâ€™t orbit another planet,
    they are round (or mostly round), and they can push other objects with their gravity.  There are also
    dwarf planets - these are almost the same, except they are not large enough to push other objects like a planet can.
