    <h1 class="scitechtitle">What is a planet?</h1>

    <div class="description">All planets have 4 things that describe them:
      <ul style="">
        <li>They orbit the sun</li>
        <li>They donâ€™t orbit another planet</li>
        <li>They are round (or mostly round)</li>
        <li>They can push other objects with their gravitational force</li>
      </ul>
      There are also dwarf planets - these are almost the same, except smaller.  Because of their size, they can't push other
      objects with their gravity like a planet can.
