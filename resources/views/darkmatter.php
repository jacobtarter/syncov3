    <h1 class="scitechtitle">How Can We Study Dark Matter? Look Inside!</h1>

    <div class="description">
      <div class="textsection">Turn the crank as you look into the viewer - Inside there are a bunch of balls,
        but only some of them are glowing, and easy to see.  As you keep turning the crank, you can see how the
        glowing balls are getting knocked around and moved, but it’s hard to tell why.  Even
        though the dark balls are very hard to see, it’s easy to see that they affect the others.
      </div>
      <div class="textsection">This is how scientists must study and learn about dark matter.  Dark matter is
        invisible to our eyes, but it is possible to observe the effect that it has on things that we
        can see.  Think about a flag - you can tell if there’s wind outside if the flag is waving, even though
        you can’t see the wind.
      </div>
      <div class="textsection">Dark matter can be something like a tiny particle, or a very large black hole. There
        are several scientific theories, and scientists still don’t agree on what exactly dark matter does within
        the Universe - but they estimate that it takes up about 84.5% of all the matter that exists!</div>
