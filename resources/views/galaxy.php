        <li>You learned how a solar system is a group of planets orbiting a sun.  A galaxy is
          similar but much bigger - it is made up of a group of stars and other objects which
          are held together by the gravitational forces of a dense object in its center, such as a black hole</li>
        <li>The pressure inside a star is so great that it forces atoms together into bigger atoms - This process
          creates a ton of energy, which is called fusion.  All matter in the Universe is created by the fusion
          of stars - including you! </li>
