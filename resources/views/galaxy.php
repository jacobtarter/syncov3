    <div class="description">
      <div class="textsection">You learned how a solar system is a group of planets orbiting a sun.  A galaxy is
          similar but much bigger - it is made up of a group of stars and other objects which
          are held together by the gravitational forces of a dense object in its center, such as a black hole</div>
      <div class="textsection">The pressure inside a star is so great that it forces atoms together into bigger atoms - This process
          is called fusion, and it creates a massive amount of energy for the star to run on - like fuel.</div>
      <div class="textsection">Did you know that all matter in the Universe is created by the fusion
          of stars? This means that everything here on Earth is made up of star-stuff - including you! </div>
