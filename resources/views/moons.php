        <li>A moon is a natural satellite, which is an object that orbits another object in a solar system.
          Some moons were formed by pieces that broke off of the “parent object”, others were captured and
          pulled in by the planet’s gravity.  Some moons are almost like Earth - they can have lakes, oceans,
          atmospheres, volcanos, lava flows, and ice.</li>
        <li>The phases of our moon are caused by a combination of the light of our Sun and the shadow cast by
          Earth.  Depending on the day of the month, the Earth will cast a different shadow, leading to the moon
          having a different portion appear to be lit up - this is how the phases change.  The diagram on this
          poster will help you see how this works.</li>
        <li>Humans have sent our own satellites into Earth’s orbit, which orbit the planet just like our moon.
          These have led to important scientific information, and allow us to use cell phones and radios.</li>
      </ul>
