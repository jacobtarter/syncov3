    <div class="description">
      <div class="textsection">Asteroids are made up of bits and pieces that were left over from when the Solar System was formed,
      which means that scientists can use them like a time capsule.</div>
      <div class="textsection">Comets are made of frozen gas, dirt, and rock.  They can be the size of a small town, with tails
          that stretch millions of miles!  Some comets take hundreds of years just to orbit the Sun once.</div>
      <div class="textsection">Meteoroids are objects made of rocky or metal material, and they travel through the solar system.
          They can be as small as a grain of rice, or as large as a car!</div>
      <div class="textsection">If a meteoroid enters the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, but gets burned up before it can reach
        the surface, it is called a meteor.  Meteor showers are the flashes of light created by the meteors getting
        vaporized.</div>
      <div class="textsection">If a meteoroid makes it all the way through our atmosphere and hits the surface of
        Earth, it is called a meteorite.</div>
