      <div class="textsectionfirst">Our eyes need light in order to see.  Galileoâ€™s telescope uses two different
        types of lenses to capture more light than our eyes can, and then focus that light back into an image
        that looks clear to us.  When our eyes get more light, we can see better!</div>
  
      <div class="textsectionlast">The lens at the end of the telescope is convex.  When light goes through a
        convex lens, it collects it and focuses it down to a single point.  The lens that your eye looks
        through is concave.  Concave lenses spread the light back out, and directs it to your eye as a clear
        picture.</div>
