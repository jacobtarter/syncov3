      <div class="textsection">The inner planets by the Sun are rocky, and the outer planets are giants made of
      gas or ice.  The giant planets don't have a solid surface like Earth does.</div>
      <div class="textsection">Many planets have a core that creates a magnetic field.  This can protect them from
          solar wind, which is produced by stars, such as our Sun.</div>
      <div class="textsection">A year is measured by the time it takes a planet to orbit its Sun.  Planets usually
          travel in an oval shaped path, which is called an ellipse.</div>
