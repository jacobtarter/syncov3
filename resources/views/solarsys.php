        <li>The inner planets by the Sun are rocky, and the outer planets are gas or icy giants.
          The giant planets donâ€™t have solid surfaces like Earth.</li>
        <li>Many planets have a core that creates a magnetic field.  This can protect them from
          solar wind, which is produced by stars, such as our Sun.</li>
        <li>A year is measured by the time it takes a planet to orbit its Sun.  Planets usually
          travel in an oval shaped path, which is called an ellipse.</li>
