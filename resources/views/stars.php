    <div class="description">
      <div class="textsection">Constellations are groups of stars that are visible from Earth.  The Northern
      and Southern Hemispheres have their own sets of constellations.  Since the same stars are visible
      from so many parts of the world, many different cultures have identified and named constellations
      throughout history - sometimes the same stars can have more than one name.</div>
      <div class="textsection">Constellations have
      been useful to us for determining seasons, creating calendars, and for navigation.  One example
      is the Big Dipper, which is often used for locating Polaris - the “North Star”.  This star appears
      to stay almost motionless by our north pole, which  has helped people know which way was North
      before they had the compass.</div>
